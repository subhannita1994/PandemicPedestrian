# The Pandemic Pedestrian
A Laravel web application to help in social distancing using Google Maps API

This app pulls the <a href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/6263531?hl=en">popular times</a> of places (wherever available) from a <a href="https://github.com/m-wrzr/populartimes">Python library</a>.
The data is then overlayed onto the map in the form of circles with radius proportional to the crowd. 
You can set your source and destination addresses, select a day and time and see how crowded the vicinity of your route can be.
